Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite was designed and operated by the European Space Agency with the aim of mapping the Earth’s gravity field with
high accuracy and spatial resolution.
For the purpose for which it was built, the spacecraft had to fly in an orbit very close to the planet’s surface and therefore a DFACs (Drag-Free and Attitude Control System) was mandatory to counteract the atmospheric drag which would led to faster orbital decay and perturbation in the gravity gradient measurement. 
The main components can be summarized in: the electrostatic gravity gradiometer, composed by 3 pairs of accelerometers in 3 orthogonal directions to measure the perturbations; the propulsion unit, made of a Xenon’s feed system and the dual Kaufman-type ion thrusters; the flow controller for the propellant mass flow rate.

The aim of the following analysis is to model and simulate of the Drag Free and Attitude Control System under nominal and off-nominal conditions.
